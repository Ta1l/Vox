- Bottom navigation
- Health API endpoint
- Vitest + Playwright configured

**M2 - PostgreSQL and persistence:** COMPLETE ✓

- Drizzle ORM
- Money utilities (integer kopecks)
- Users table migration
- Database connection tested

**M3 - Income tracking:** COMPLETE ✓
- Income entry schema with state machine (EARNED/IN_TRANSIT/RECEIVED/DELAYED/CANCELLED)
- State transition validation (RULE-I3)
- Income domain service
- Financial invariants: RULE-I1 (received only counts), RULE-I2 (in-transit separate)

## Current database state

No finalized schema yet.

---

## Current AI state

No AI integration yet.

---

## Current deployment state

Not deployed.

---

## Current tests

None yet.

---

## Known architectural constraints

- Money stored as integer kopecks.
- Expected income is not current balance.
- HARD money cannot be reallocated by AI.
- AI cannot write directly to PostgreSQL.
- All AI financial allocations require deterministic validation.
- User ownership is included from the beginning.
- Mobile UX is the primary UX.

---

## Current milestone

**Milestone 3:** COMPLETE ✓

Income tracking with state lifecycle implemented.

---

## Next action

Proceed to M4: Expenses
- Expense entry schema
- Categories
- Mobile expense form
- Expense reduces available balance immediately
